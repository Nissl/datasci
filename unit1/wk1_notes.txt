Data science 

Substantive expertise - ask the right questions, understand the structure of the data set, communicate findings clearly.

Data science can solve problems like
- rec movies on Netflix
- make FB feed
- suggest follows on twitter
- webapps - OKC, Uber, etc. - improve UI, publish findings

Unexpected problems
- bioinformatics
- urban planning - e.g. Chicago bus crowding
- astrophysics - databases from sky survey
- public health - target buildings that produce emergencies
- sports - huge amounts of movement data (Tor. Raptors)

Data scientists use Pandas - a Python package. R + Python = Pandas. 

Useful for manipulating data, implements some of the best R features. R-lite.

Data in Pandas is contained in a structure called a dataframe. A Dataframe is a 2d labeled data structure. String, int, float, boolean. There maybe NaN entries for not specified.

loaded data into df.

df['age'] - lists column
df.loc['a'] - lists row a

vectorized operations

d = {'one': Series([1., 2., 3.], index=['a', 'b', 'c'])
	'two': Series([1., 2., 3., 4.], index=['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']}

df = Dataframe(d)

df.apply(numpy.mean)
df['one'].map(lambda x: x>=1)
df.applymap(lambda x: x>=1)

First dataset: riders on the Titanic. You'll build several models. Can we predict who will or won't survive?

Class project: pull data on Subway ridership and Weather Underground data. Does weather influence Subway riding? Can we predict? Is it busier at some times rather than others?

Good data scientist: what are you interested in? (Unless you're an uber-nerd who loves to find patterns in things.) Have an inquisitive mindset.

Lesson 2: acquiring and massaging data into a workable format.
